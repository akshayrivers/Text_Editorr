# Yonro's Terminal based text editor

Initially it had been a faithful implementation of the text editor built in the [Hecto tutorial](https://www.flenker.blog/hecto/). But I have enhanced and changed it into something which I can use as a writer and also it is also to challenge myself as a programmer.
For detailed notes please refer to /notes.md

## Demo

### Single Pane

### Multi-Pane Support

## Overview & Design Philosophy

Instead of jumping directly into features, the editor was built in layers:

- Terminal control
- Rendering
- Editing
- Search
- Highlighting
- Pane Abstraction
- Extensibility

Each phase builds on the previous one, gradually evolving the editor from a
simple terminal viewer into a fully functional text editor.

For more details on the architecture, check out my [Medium blog](INSERT_MEDIUM_BLOG_LINK_HERE).

### Pane Abstraction

The editor now supports a sophisticated pane management system:

- **Layout Tree**: A recursive structure that manages splitting the screen horizontally and vertically.
- **Pane Manager**: Tracks active panes and handles focus switching.
- **View Component**: Each pane contains a `View` which is responsible for rendering and editing its own buffer.

This allows for flexible window management, similar to modern editors like Vim or VSCode.

Some guiding principles during development:

- Keep core editor synchronous and stable
- Prefer simple data structures first
- Unicode correctness over premature optimization
- Stateless rendering where possible
- Design for extensibility (plugins later)

This allowed the editor to evolve organically while keeping complexity manageable.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- Rust (stable)
- Terminal with UTF-8 support

### Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akshayrivers/Text_Editor.git
cd Text_Editor
cargo run
```

## Keybindings

| Key        | Action      |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Ctrl-S     | Save file   |
| Ctrl-Q     | Quit        |
| Ctrl-F     | Search      |
| Arrow Keys | Move cursor |
| Ctrl-Z.    | Undo        |
| Ctrl-R.    | Redo        |

### Core Components

| Component   | Responsibility                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Editor      | Command dispatch and state         |
| Buffer      | Text storage and manipulation      |
| Line        | Grapheme-aware text representation |
| Highlighter | Syntax + search highlighting       |
| Renderer    | Terminal drawing                   |
| Terminal    | Crossterm abstraction              |

This separation keeps the core editor logic clean and extensible.
